#Autumn summative project

## What is in my folder?

This folder contains 2 sub-folders:

1\. old_work_with_wrong_data_set_used

2\. new_work_with_correct_data_set_used

### 1. old_work_with_wrong_data_set_used

This folder contains work produced when the wrong data set was used. This folder contains cleaning of the old data, as well as 2 map plots being produced to show 'covid cases per country per million', and 'death rates per country per million', found in the graph_work files. The files have been numbered in ascending order, with the highest number being the most recently edited version.

### 2. new_work_with_correct_data_set_used

This folder has been produced when using the correct data set, and contains all relevant data cleaning and a summertive plot of the patients studied in the data set in order to give context of the data. Again,the files have been numbered in ascending order, with the highest number being the most recently edited version.
